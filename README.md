# Regueatonator Readme

Thanks for accesing this project! This is the Reggueatonator, a simple javascript project to generate random lines for using in any reggeaton song according to the funny instructons provided by a TV parody.  Please don't take the subject seriously, it's just for fun!

## Introduction

This program was created as a practice project in my Codecademy training. The assignment, called Mixed Messages, requested us to provide a random message generator from at least three sources of content. 
The conditions provided immediatly reminded me of a TV parody about a loved - and hated - songwriter who is very popular in Latinamerica, Ricardo Arjona. A comedy show in Sony Television provided ready-to-use instructions to compose songs in the artist's signature style. My first idea was to turn those instructions into an automated system. 
Unfortunately, the instructions were too vague for a computer to implement or for me to adapt them to this exercise. I then remembered a very similar parody where similar instructions were provided for composing random lines in the catchy and popular rythm of **reggeaton**.  
In the case of the parody, aired by the Spanish TV broadcaster Antena 3 in a show called El Hormiguero 3.0, a 92 year old man provided specific instructions to turn five sets of data into full sentences with all the characteristics of many of the most popular Regueaton songs. The purpose of the show was to make some fun of the repeated hyper sexualized tropes of those lyrics, so I think it would be a fun inspiration for my project.

## The project

In order to fulfill the requirements of both the exercise and the parody, I will be using five arrays of content (subject, desire statement, naughty verb, sensual adverb, timeframe and final phrasal adjective). This components are randomly joined to provide a single sentence with the usual characteristics of a reggeaton line.
For the nature of both the rythm itself and the parody, this lyrics are generated in Spanish,  and a intermmediate level of Spanish will be required to understand and enjoy the outcome.
In order not to infringe any copyrights, I will not use the components suggested by the parody as examples, but I am very confident the outcome will be very similar to that of the comedy writers.
Following the instructions, I am using Javascript as the language of the project and I wrote the code on Visual Studio Code with Git as verion control.  
I hope you would have as much fun using this code as I do writing it.
